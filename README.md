# ELIXIR PHOENIX HANGMAN GAME

This repo derives from [this one](github.com:Exadra37/elixir-for-programmers-2_learning.git) I used while following along the video course [Elixir for Programmers - Second Edition](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers-2) from PragDave.


## ROADMAP

* [ ] - Add a score board to enable people to compete for the best score.
* [ ] - Add Phoenix presence to show how many users are online.
* [ ] - Add support for different dictionaries.
